# Portfolio
A portfolio template made using HTML, CSS, bootstrap and PHP.

# Origin & Goals
I wanted to make an online portfolio to showcase my projects and contribute to my online presence.Due to the lack of other meaningful projects, I decided to post it here as a template.

# Development
Originally I wanted to make this site using only HTML and CSS, but after seeing some sites made with bootstrap and what can be done with it, I decided to also add it.The site also contains a contact form that works with a php script to send information to my mail.<br/>

# Design
There are 5 sections:<br/> 
1.the home section, which has a button that links to the project section and a greeting,<br/>
2.the about me section, which contains general information about the owner, as well as contact information(phone number, mail),<br/>
3.the skills section, which showcases the skills,<br/>
4.the project section, which houses the projects of the owner,<br/>
5.finally the contact section which has a contact form that can be used to contact the owner.<br/>

The site also has a navigation bar which is alway visible and the contact form has a google captcha that is not visible because I have not included the keys for security reasons.The images used are all free and are taken from unsplash.com.

# Improvements to be Made
The site needs optimization, it takes too long to load.<br/>
The skills can be displayed better.
